# This .gitignore tells Git which files and folders to ignore.
# Ignored files are:
# - not tracked in your local .git history
# - not committed
# - not pushed to GitHub

# API KEYS & SECRETS
# Any files with sensitive info (API keys, tokens, passwords) go here.
# Example: if your keys are in "Secrets.swift", add that line below.
# IMPORTANT: Keep backups of your secrets in a safe place!

# PERSONAL XCODE SETTINGS
# These store YOUR personal Xcode preferences - which files you had open,
# window positions, breakpoints, etc. Everyone has different settings,
# so committing these causes constant merge conflicts with your team.

# BUILD OUTPUTS & CACHE
# Xcode generates these every time you build. They're huge (100s of MB),
# change constantly, and are unnecessary to save permanently.

# SWIFT PACKAGE MANAGER
# If you use Swift Package Manager for dependencies:
# - .build/  = compiled artifacts and cache (regenerated automatically)
# - .swiftpm/ = SPM workspace/metadata (also regenerated as needed)
# None of this needs to be committed.

# MACOS SYSTEM FILES
